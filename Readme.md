This is a quick and dirty sample project intended to demonstrate a way
of using Parse Push to teach an application to refresh automatically
when fresh content is available rather than relying on polling
mechansims like drag to refresh. This project was used as a
demonstration at a Parse meetup. The slides can be found at
